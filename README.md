## About College Management System
> Admin has full control of the system, all the functions are to be performed from Admin panel. Here, the user can use the features of CRUD and manage students, fees, bank, teachers, subjects, classes, streams, hostel, timetable, events, notices/announcement, exam result, fee structure, attendance. Login sessions can also be viewed from the admin panel. Now talking about all the main functions of the system, that is the feature to add, edit, delete and view students, teachers, classes, hostels, streams, and management of Fees. While adding a student, the user has to provide full name, select gender, date of birth, attach photos, registration number, select class, stream, hostel, date of joining, category, academic year, total fees, advance fees, balance, and parents.

> Likewise, while adding teachers, the user should provide name, select gender, age, phone number, email id, and staff number. For the payment of the fees, the fees structure section should declare the fee amount. All the payments are done through banks. So it is necessary to have bank section here. And the user can add bank name with an account number which is needed during payment of fees of a student. For the payment of fees, he/she has to select a student’s name, session, provide the paid amount, select bank branch, and remarks. Not just students and the teacher, here the user has to add subject and classes details too. Its too easy to add subjects and classes, he/she just has to provide a subject and class name. And talking about the streams its the also has the same procedure.
